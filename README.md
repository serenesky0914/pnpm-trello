The idea of this task is building a very simple non-interactive Trello board that automatically updates while the web app is open.

We provide a basic setup and a functional first version of the desired web app in this repo. The web app consumes this GraphQL endpoint: [frontend.hiring.iodevnet.com/graphql](https://frontend.hiring.iodevnet.com/graphql), which takes care of generating new mock tasks and changing their status, so that you can focus solely on the UI.

## Goals of the task

### Real-time updates

1. Poll the backend every second or every few seconds **without** using Apollo’s `pollInterval`.
2. Store your tasks grouped by `status` in your own data structure or structures (e.g. three separate arrays).
3. Use your structure created in the previous step to render the data.

### UI

1. Build a UI with 3 columns that looks a bit better than the one we provided.
2. Render the name of each task instead of its ID.
3. Each column should have its own separate scroll.

## What will we be paying attention to?

1. Coding style and consistency.
2. CSS knowledge. Go ahead and impress us.
3. React lifecycle knowledge.
4. Performance considerations.
